  @md{
    The cautionary tale behind this Rune is well known among wizards across the @b{Multiverse}.
    
    The perimiter of the @b{Growing Desert} still increases by miniscule amounts every year.
    The spawner at the center of it creates a grain of sand every few minutes.  
    
    Buried deep beneath the sand mountain at the center of the desert is the village once called @b{Forest's Edge},
    whose resident wizard was skilled enough to create the sand spawner, but not skilled enough to destroy it.
